# There are four ways this Makefile can be called:
#
#
# 1.  As a subdirectory from the toplevel, for automake
#
# 2.  A wrapper around the kernel's makefile when building modules, to
#     possibly override the .config file
#
# 3.  At configure time, as the toplevel module dir for building
#     kernel tests
#
# 4.  At configure time, to determine the kernel's idea of $(ARCH)
